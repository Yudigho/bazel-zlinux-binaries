# bazel-zlinux-binaries
Fred's precompiled Bazel binaries for zLinux.

Each version of Bazel has its own dedicated subdirectory.

Currently I only have binaries for RHEL 7 here.

There's also a subdirectory `tf-dev-conf` with a modified version of
[my TensorFlow development environment](https://github.com/frreiss/tf-dev-conf).
This will be replaced with a branch of the original environment soon.
